# SuperDuo
Android Developer Nanodegree

In this project, I productionize two apps, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state.
To do this, I find and handle error cases, add accessibility features, allow for localization, add widgets, and add a library.
I received grade “Exceeds Specifications” by certified Udacity code reviewer
